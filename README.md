# MLOps Project - Fall 2024 🚀

Welcome to our MLOps project repository! This project is aimed at extending our existing MLOps pipeline by integrating cutting-edge tools like MLFlow for model versioning, Airflow for workflow automation, and leveraging full-stack application capabilities with CI/CD pipelines for Docker and Kubernetes deployment. Let's make our machine learning more reproducible and scalable! 🛠️

## Project Overview 📄

This project is a group activity that builds on our earlier efforts from Class Task 7. We're focused on:
- **MLFlow Integration:** For model versioning and tracking.
- **Airflow Automation:** To streamline workflows.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Using frameworks like React for the frontend and Flask/FastAPI for the backend.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Implementing and managing continuous integration and deployment using GitHub Actions.

## Submission Guidelines 📝

- Ensure to use the same group as in Class Task 7.
- You may consult AI tools like ChatGPT for ideas, but direct content use is prohibited.
- Strict plagiarism rules apply as per university guidelines.
- **Deadline:** 6th December 11:55 pm.

## Features 🌟

- **Data Version Control (DVC)** for managing datasets and models.
- **Model Monitoring & Maintenance** to ensure optimal performance.
- **Professional Blog Documentation** on Medium to showcase our implementation.
