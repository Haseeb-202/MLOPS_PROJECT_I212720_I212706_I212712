# MLOps Application – Fall 2024 🚀

Welcome to the **MLOps Full-Stack Pipeline Application**, an end-to-end system designed to streamline the development, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models at scale. This repository integrates industry-grade tools such as **Apache Airflow** for workflow orchestration, **MLFlow** for model lifecycle management, and complete **CI/CD pipelines** for seamless deployments using Docker and Kubernetes.

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a scalable and modular architecture for delivering machine learning solutions with reliability, traceability, and automation. Key highlights include:

- 📦 **Model Versioning with MLFlow**  
- ⚙️ **Workflow Automation with Apache Airflow**  
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Web Interface** using React (Frontend) and Flask/FastAPI (Backend)  
- 🔁 **CI/CD Pipelines** with GitHub Actions for Docker and Kubernetes deployments  
- 📊 **Monitoring and Logging** for model and application performance  
- 📁 **Data & Model Version Control (DVC)** for reproducibility  

## 🔧 Features

- **MLFlow Tracking Server** for experiment logging and model registry  
- **Apache Airflow DAGs** for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment  
- **Frontend Dashboard** built with React for triggering training runs, visualizing metrics, and managing models  
- **Backend APIs** for orchestrating workflows and serving models  
- **CI/CD Workflows**:  
  - Linting, testing, and container builds  
  - Auto-deployment to Kubernetes or cloud-native services  
- **Professional Documentation** and blog posts for public sharing and technical transparency
